### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Rishabh Tatia, and my passion lies in developing software that helps make everyone's lives easier! I got into programming through my interest in applied math and solving problems on Project Euler when I was in highschool. The majority of my experience so far lies in web development but I've also been interested in and learning data science.

Here are some projects I'm proud of:
- Full Stack:
  - [TAMU Datathon](https://github.com/tamu-datathon-org) (the best Hackathon imo)
  - [WIEAT](https://github.com/tatiaris/wieat-frontend) (Web-based Interactive Episode Analysis Tool)
- Backend:
  - [Quizhack](https://github.com/tatiaris/quizhack) (Quizlet scraper / API that combines study sets)
  - RusticMojo (SQL based e-commerce website for hand made women's accessories)
- Frontend:
  - [ACELAB](https://acelab.tamu.edu/) (Applied Cognitive Ergonomics Lab)
  - [Typo](https://github.com/tatiaris/typo) (Typing progress tracker, no longer supported :'( )
- Data Science:
  - [Covid-19 vs Governments](https://github.com/tatiaris/covid-vs-governments) (Analysis of covid-19 impact on different types of governments)

Fun Fact: I love playing racquet sports!
