### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Rishabh Tatia, and my passion lies in developing software that helps make everyone's lives easier! I got into programming through my interest in applied math and solving problems on Project Euler when I was in highschool. The majority of my experience so far lies in web development but I'm also interested in data science and mobile/desktop app development.

  - [Resuville](https://resuville.com) (Free to use Resume building website)
  - [TAMU Datathon](https://github.com/tamu-datathon-org) (the best data science competition imo)
- Backend Focused:

  - [TAMU Degree Planner](https://github.com/tatiaris/degreeplanner) (Aggie Degree Planning Tool)
