### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Rishabh Tatia, and my passion lies in developing software that helps make everyone's lives easier! I got into programming through my interest in applied math and solving problems on Project Euler when I was in highschool. The majority of my experience so far lies in web development but I'm also interested in data science and mobile/desktop app development.

Here are some projects I'm proud of:
- Full Stack:
  - [Resubae](https://resubae.net) (Free to use Resume building website)
  - [TAMU Datathon](https://github.com/tamu-datathon-org) (the best Hackathon imo)
  - [WIEAT](https://github.com/tatiaris/wieat-frontend) (Web-based Interactive Episode Analysis Tool)
- Backend:
  - [TAMU Degree Planner](https://github.com/tatiaris/degreeplanner) (Aggie Degree Planning Tool)
  - [RusticMojo](https://github.com/tatiaris/rustic-mojo) (SQL based e-commerce website for hand made women's accessories)
- Frontend:
  - [ACELAB](https://acelab.tamu.edu/) (Applied Cognitive Ergonomics Lab)
